# Gas-Turbine-CO-and-NO2-Emission-Prediction

Dataset source: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Gas+Turbine+CO+and+NOx+Emission+Data+Set

Parameters that are provided in the dataset are gas turbine parameter (e.g. compressor discharge pressure) and ambiance variable (e.g. ambient temperature). This model is created to predict gas turbine CO and NO2 emission. The result of this prediction can be used as comparison with real time measurements from the gas emission sensor, and then we can see if the sensor need to be recalibrated or not

Random Forest algorithm is used in this model with r2 score: 0.84
